            /*Hurdle Jump!
            
            Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's jump height, and
            determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.

            A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than equal to the hurdle height.

            hurdleJump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) ➞ true

            hurdleJump([5, 5, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ false

            hurdleJump([5, 4, 5, 6], 10) ➞ true

            hurdleJump([1, 2, 1], 1) ➞ false

            Notes

            Return true for the edge case of an empty array of hurdles. (Zero hurdles means that any jump height can clear them).

            /*Convert Number to Corresponding Month Name!
             
            Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string.
            For example, if you're given 3 as input, your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.

            You can expect only integers ranging from 1 to 12 as test input.
